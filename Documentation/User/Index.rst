Video
=====
If set up correctly, no special attention is required from editors.
You can set the video to autoplay, so the visitor only needs to click once to start the video.

iFrame
======
Use the new content element of type "iFrame with consent":

.. figure:: ../Images/CeIframe.png
   :alt: CE "iFrame with consent" Form
   :class: with-shadow

   CE "iFrame with consent" Form

You can choose an aspect ratio or height for the iframe and add a background image for the placeholder.
